# Auto Insurance Premium Analysis

## The Data

Our data was collected from an analytics team at TheMarkup.org.

The data set was produced by AllState in 2013. It includes the information of approximately one-hundred thousand auto insurance policy holders over a six-month period. 

## Factors Considered

Birth date, gender, current premium, and indicated premium

## Questions

1. Do premiums change based on policy holderâ€™s age?
2. Do premiums change based on gender?
3. What are the trends in algorithmic loss models of large insurance companies such as AllState?

## Methodology

-Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Datetime
-Data aggregation with the median 
-Data binning and grouping
-Line graph, bar chart, pie graph, scatter plot, correlation factor


## Conclusions

-Auto insurance premiums can both vary and trend by age. 
-Auto insurance premiums can both vary and trend by gender. 
-Using the new loss model, the indicated premium tended to be lower for older age groups and higher for younger age groups.
