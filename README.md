# Auto Insurance Premium Analysis

## The Data

Our data was collected from an analytics team at TheMarkup.org.

The data set was produced by AllState in 2013. It includes the information of approximately one-hundred thousand auto insurance policy holders over a six-month period.

## Questions

1. Do premiums change based on policy holder’s age?

## Methodology
